## Talk Description

We all use it, and yet most of us only scratch the surface. Let's extend our Gradle knowledge, and discover tricks to make us more productive!

We'll learn some CLI tricks to run Gradle tasks faster, how to use caching and continuous mode to make our testing workflow blazingly fast, discover that debugging Gradle scripts actually is a thing, how to use the Gradle Profiler to determine how much faster our builds with the new Kotlin K2 compiler will be or how to benchmark our incremental build times, and much more!

## Note ðŸ—’

This repo contains the scenario files, benchmarks, and speaker notes used in the talk.

I didn't add the okhttp / nowinandroid changes, since those depend on the Git branching, and would be separate repos.
